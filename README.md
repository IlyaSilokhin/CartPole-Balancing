# CartPole-Balancing
Custom DQN Model to solve the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium.

This project implements a custom Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent using Python and TensorFlow to solve the CartPole-v1 environment. The agent learns to interact with an environment through trial and error, using a neural network to estimate action values (Q-values).

## 🚀 Features

- Deep Q-Network with experience replay
- Target network for stable training
- Double DQN to reduce overestimation
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Training visualizations and episode GIF exports
- Option to save/load models

## 🏗 Environment

This agent is tested on:

- `CartPole-v1`
